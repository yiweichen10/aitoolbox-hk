# Automation memory — add new English tool to aitoolbox.hk

2026-10-03: Added new English tool **arcads** (Arcads, category AI Video) — AI UGC ad studio with 300-1,500 AI actors. Chosen for a strong monetization angle (sell UGC ad creative at ~$11/clip vs $80-200 human creators). Not previously in data/tools_en.json (was 212 tools).

Process (canonical, reuse next run):
1. Wrote tool JSON to temp `_tool_arcads.json` (all fields: name/slug/url/category/price/description/pricing_details/pros/cons/faq/badge/color/emoji/platform/rating/tags/features/content/published).
2. `price` = short card label "From $77/mo · ~$11 per video" (28 chars); full pricing in `pricing_details`.
3. Upserted via `python scripts/upsert_tool_en.py _tool_arcads.json` → 1 added, total 213.
4. `python scripts/check_price_labels.py` → PASS 213 tools, 0 polluted.
5. `python scripts/build_en.py` → exit 0; tool page at tools/arcads/index.html, sitemap 213 tools, IndexNow pushed 1 URL (HTTP 200), OG image generated.
6. Committed + pushed to aitoolbox-hk main: commit b7e97e902 (prev 5f9e0f7a3). Worktree clean.

Notes for next run: no root Chinese tools.json exists — pick from trending global tools. Build log labels paths as `en/tools/<slug>/index.html` but actual output is root-relative `tools/<slug>/index.html`. Pillow IS available now (OG images generated OK).
