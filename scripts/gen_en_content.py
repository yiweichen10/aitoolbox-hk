=== AEO + GEO Writing Standards (must strictly follow) ===

[BLUF — Bottom Line Up Front]
The first line of body content must be a Markdown blockquote starting with "> Bottom line:" giving the core conclusion in 40-60 words. No "In this article we will explore..." filler. AI engines extract only the first 1-2 sentences as answers.

[Expert/Authority Quote]
The second line must be another Markdown blockquote quoting a real industry expert, official institution, or research report, with attribution. Real examples:
> "The core value of a note tool isn't feature count—it's whether you can still open your notes ten years from now." —— Nick Milo, Obsidian community core contributor
> "AI tool monthly fees aren't a cost—they're a fraction of your hourly rate. Picking the wrong tool wastes 5+ hours/week." —— Andrej Karpathy, 2026-03 X post
Do not fabricate names or quotes. Use real public figures/institutions/reports. If no suitable quote, cite the author's own test records with "—— Author test record, YYYY-MM".

[Question-Style H2 Headings]
All H2 (## prefix) must be questions or question-oriented statements:
- NOT: ## Coding Capability Comparison
- YES: ## Which Is Better at Coding? Claude Wins, No Contest
- NOT: ## Pricing Analysis
- YES: ## Which Is More Cost-Effective? Same Price, But a Hidden Catch
- NOT: ## Pitfalls
- YES: ## What Pitfalls Should You Watch For?
Reason: AI engines (ChatGPT/Perplexity/Google AI Overviews) match content by user questions. Question-style H2s boost citation rate 30%+.

[BLUF Paragraphs]
The first sentence of each paragraph must directly give the conclusion/answer (40-60 words), then expand with background, details, cases. No "First let's understand the background..." preamble — AI skips it.

[Short Paragraphs]
2-3 sentences per paragraph for AI programmatic parsing. Paragraphs over 4 sentences must be split.

[Sourced Statistics]
The full content must include at least 3-5 statistics with sources:
- Wrong: "many users"
- Right: "1.2B monthly active users (source: Notion 2026 Q1 earnings)"
- Wrong: "fast"
- Right: "2.8s average response time (source: Author 2026-04 test, 50 runs averaged)"
Data source priority: official earnings/Model Cards > industry associations > authoritative media > third-party data platforms > author tests. Do not fabricate data.

[FAQ Section]
Content must end with "## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)" section, 3-5 real user questions, each answer 50-100 words, direct conclusion. No encyclopedic pseudo-FAQs like "What is X? X is a...". Write real user doubts.

[Final Verdict Section]
After FAQ, must have "## Final Verdict: Which Should You Choose?" (or scenario-appropriate "how to choose/use/which is worth it") section, with a summary table (your need → recommendation → monthly cost/reason), ending with the author's clear recommendation.

[Internal Links]
AI tool names in content must use <a href="/tools/{slug}/index.html">Tool Name</a> format for internal links (slug = tool English hyphenated name, e.g. chatgpt, claude, cursor, deepseek, kimi, perplexity, notion-ai, etc.). First mention of each tool gets a link; subsequent mentions use plain name.

[Prohibitions]
- No keyword stuffing (GEO tested -8% negative effect)
- No pseudo-FAQs (template Q&A for search engines is dead per Google)
- No "ultimate guide", "must-see", "game-changer" marketing words
- No emoji overuse (only in lists where needed, not in body paragraphs)
- No "In this article we will explore", "First let's understand" filler
